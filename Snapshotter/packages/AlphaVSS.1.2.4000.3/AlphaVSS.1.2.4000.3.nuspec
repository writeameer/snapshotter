    <description>AlphaVSS is a .NET class library released under the MIT license providing a managed API for the Volume Shadow Copy Service also known as VSS., that is included in Windows XP and later windows versions. The Volume Shadow Copy Service is a set of COM interfaces that implements a framework to allow volume backups to be performed while applications on a system continue to write to the volumes.

AlphaVSS, written in C# and C++/CLI provides a managed interface to this API.

The goal of AlphaVSS is to provide an interface that is simple to use from any .NET application, yet provides the full functionality of VSS.</description>
